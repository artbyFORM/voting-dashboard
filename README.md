# FORM Voting Dashboard
This dashboard is designed to streamline the voting process for FORM events. Everything needed to vote on a given submission is now contained into a single tab, eliminating the need to open each submission in a new tab to listen to it. 

It will also have many other handy features soon, such as keyboard shortcuts, timestamped comments, etc.
